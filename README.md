# GBP-Net

This is the code of TMI 2025 Paper “Glancing Beyond Patch: Spatial Contextual Cues for 3D Neuron Segmentation”.
Our code framework is based on PyTorch connectomics. https://github.com/zudi-lin/pytorch_connectomics


In addition, we have also uploaded a sample image from our ZBFWB dataset.
For more information about the zbfwb dataset, please refer to X. Du, Z. Yue, J. Wei, W. Li, M. Chen, T. Chen, H. Hu, H. Ren, Z. Jia, X. Ning et al., “Central nervous system atlas of larval zebrafish constructed using the morphology of single excitatory and inhibitory neurons,” bioRxiv, pp. 2025–06, 2025.
