# GBP-Net

This is the code implementation of Paper “Glancing Beyond Patch: Spatial Contextual Cues for 3D Neuron Segmentation”.
The code will be published after the paper is accepted.

In addition, we have also uploaded a sample image from our ZBFWB dataset. This dataset is part of our other work, which will be fully released upon publication.
